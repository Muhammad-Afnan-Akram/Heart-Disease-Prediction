# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction with and without Feature Selction
This project aims to predict the occurrence of heart disease in patients using data science techniques. We have used two methods for heart disease prediction - one with feature selection and one without feature selection. We have used the Framingham dataset for this task. This dataset contains information about various risk factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits, which are used to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

The dataset contains a large number of instances with imbalanced classes. To handle this issue, we have performed resampling on the dataset to balance the number of instances in each class. Our preprocessing steps are discussed in the ipynb file, which includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.

For heart disease prediction, we have used various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These algorithms have been implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. We have evaluated the performance of these algorithms using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve.

Our project is available on Github, where you can find the code, dataset, and the preprocessed data. You can use this project as a reference for heart disease prediction using data science techniques. This project can be extended to other datasets and can be used to predict other diseases as well. We hope this project will be useful for the data science community and will contribute to the development of better healthcare systems.
